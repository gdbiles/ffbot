A python based discord bot for fantasy football leagues.

Currently supports leagues on:

- Yahoo

Plan to support leagues on:

- Sleeperbot

- ESPN


Description
===========

For a long time, our fantasy league has suffered from resource sprawl.

We currently use: email, GroupMe (lol), Yahoo chat, SMS, and various internet
calling services to perform functions necessary to fantasy football operations.

The goal of this projects is to centralize leagues on Discord. This way,
everything including: smack talk, live game discussion, trade proposals, rule changes,
roster comparison, braggadocio, and league updates can exist in one place.
